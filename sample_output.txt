This file is just to give you an idea how your Application should behave.

Suppose we have 2 clients and a server


Start server and clients using following commands:

    python3 server.py -p 9000
    python3 client.py -p 9000 -u client1
    python3 client.py -p 9000 -u client2

Now, Client1 inputs following three messages:

    list
    msg 1 client2 hello!
    msg 3 client2 client1 client4 hello again!


And then, client2 inputs following [suppose there is a file abc.txt that contains some text]:

    list
    file 1 client1 abc.txt


After the completion of above commands, both clients input quit and shutdown.


Now, after all the above commands execution, Server will have following messages on screen:

    join: client1
    join: client2
    request_users_list: client1
    msg: client1
    msg: client1
    msg: client1 to non-existent user client4
    request_users_list: client2
    file: client2
    disconnected: client1
    disconnected: client2


Client1 terminal output will look something like that:
    
    list: client1 client2
    msg: client1: hello again!
    file: client2: abc.txt 
    quitting

Client2 terminal output will look something like this:
    
    msg: client1: hello!
    msg: client1: hello again!
    list: client1 client2
    quitting


The messages that will be exchanged between server and clients will be as follows:

client1 -> server: join client1
client2 -> server: join client2

client1 -> server: request_users_list
server -> client1: response_users_list 2 client1 client2

client1 -> server: send_message 1 client2 hello!
server -> client2: forward_message 1 client1 hello!

client1 -> server: send_message 3 client2 client1 client4 hello again!
server -> client1: forward_message client1 hello again!
server -> client2: forward_message client1 hello again!

client2 -> server: request_users_list
server -> client2: response_users_list 2 client1 client2
client2 -> server: send_file 1 client1 abc.txt {file_data}
server -> client1: forward_file 1 client2 abc.txt {file_data}

client1 -> server: disconnect client1
client2 -> server: disconnect client2
